# odin-recipes

This website will be about recipes and it will be my first project in HTML from the The Odin Project.

This is a great possibility to put in practice my basic knowledge of HTML that I learned in the previous lessons. I want to be able to create the boilerplate of this website, to use headings, paragraphs, links, images and lists and create the basic structure of it.
