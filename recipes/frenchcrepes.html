    <h2>French Crêpes</h2>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
          <li>1¼ teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>3 eggs</li>
          <li>2 cups milk</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Sift flour, sugar, and salt into a bowl; set aside. Beat eggs and milk together in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Beat in flour mixture until smooth; stir in melted butter.</li>
          <li>Lightly grease a griddle or frying pan; heat over medium-high heat.</li>
          <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 2 tablespoons for each crêpe. Immediately rotate the skillet to spread batter out in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Shake the pan or loosen with a spatula; turn or flip it over and cook until other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
